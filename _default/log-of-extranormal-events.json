These individuals went unnoticed by the guards in the area for seventeen (17) minutes before one guard in the room suddenly screamed and proceeded to open fire on the group in a panic, killing approximately seven (7) of them and sending the rest scattering, none of which bled from their wounds. Other guards rushed into the room, but seemed to take no notice of the anomalous humanoids, instead choosing to restrain the panicked guard.

Local law enforcement arrived in the scene, neutralizing the 'Dabi' entity, but not before the location itself was burnt down, and 26 casualties were reported.<br />\n**Date of Occurrence:** 7/24/2018<br />\n**Location:** Cebu City, Philippines<br />\n**Follow-up Actions Taken:** CCTV footage was altered to remove traces of the 'Dabi' entity, and a cover-up story involving a case of arson is released. Autopsy of 'Dabi' remains revealed that its DNA was 73% genetically similar to a Philippine goat, the remaining 26% to a domestic chicken. Interview of said female cosplayer (who survived) revealed that the entity was the product of a ritual she found in █████████.com (now inactive), and was subsequently given Class-A amnestics.<br />\n<br />\n**Event Description:** Popular television network Nickelodeon aired the first showing of the Sponge bob Square pants Movie, if the film was viewed in the town of ██████████, Quebec.

At the time no actual anomaly was found and operations proceeded as normal. In 1984 Site-15 underwent a routine casual scan which detected retro-casual ectoentropic interference in the events of his death which was confirmed by further scans. To this day the actual alterations made and the entity responsible are unknown.<br />\n**Date of Occurrence:** 06/13/1977<br />\n**Location:** Site-15<br />\n**Follow-up Actions Taken:** ███████ █████'s family was told that he died in a civilian construction operation.

The &quot;Channel Tunnel&quot; is 50.45 kilometers (31.35 miles) long; as such, the train would have had to travel at a speed exceeding 3664 km/h (2401 mph) in order to travel the required distance. Security footage inside the tunnel went static during the entire event, and a speed recorder on the second engine in line indicated that the train did not exceed 153 km/h (~95 mph) at any point during the trip. The leading locomotive was found to contain [DATA EXPUNGED] inside the fuel tank, as well as six (6) large tubes sticking out of the engine block that were linked directly to the traction motors of the locomotive.

The rail worker who modified the locomotive is currently held at Site-11 for further questioning; the locomotive is currently stored at Site-53 pending further analysis.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n**Event Description:** On the 12/██/200█ at 16:02 UTC a Cessna 172 Skyhawk aircraft vanished off radar screens at an altitude of 2100 Ft (640 Meters) near the city of Inverness, Scotland, UK. It re-emerged out of a lone cumulus cloud at an altitude of 1100 Ft (335 Meters) at 17:27 UTC roughly near where it was last seen. Radio contact was achieved between air traffic control (ATC) and the pilot where a long dialogue was exchanged, where the ATC mentioned that he (the pilot) had been missing for almost 1 hour and 30 minutes. In the recorded audio, the pilot could be heard slightly panicking, saying that he flew into a &quot;mere cumulus cloud&quot; and took less than a minute to emerge out on the other side only to find out the sun had abruptly changed position in the sky, he had rapidly lost altitude and noticed that there were no other clouds around when he &quot;clearly sighted multiple other clouds&quot; before he entered the said cumulus cloud. The pilot, who has been identified as John █████, landed safely at Inverness airport with no issues shortly after.<br />\n**Date of Occurrence:** 12/██/200█ 16:02 UTC -- 17:27 UTC<br />\n**Location:** 28 Km (17 mi) directly south of Inverness, Scotland, UK.<br />\n**Follow Up Actions Taken:** All people who witnessed or knew about the event, including the ATC, airport staff and responding personnel, were administered Class A Amnestics by Foundation operatives disguised as local police.

The Cessna 172 aircraft is in storage at Site-77 awaiting further examination for any clues that could solve this event.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n**Event Description:** On the ██/██/2003 at 00:14 UTC (21:14 local time) a large bright object was seen traveling across the night sky south west of the town of Ushuaia, southern Argentina. Initially it was thought to be a meteor, and witness accounts reported how its brightness increased to rival that of Venus, and it traveled rather fast in the sky before fading away and disappearing completely. Roughly an hour later many people in and around Ushuaia began to experience anomalous symptoms including rashes, persistent vomiting, and high fever. People who were closest to the location of the bright object experienced worse symptoms that vaguely resembled that of the Black Death, Formally known as the Bubonic Plague.<br />\n**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/2003<br />\n**Location:** 17 Km south west of Ushuaia, Southern Argentina.<br />\n**Follow Up Actions Taken:** Uninfected witnesses administered Class A amnestics; All who experienced non-life threatening symptoms given appropriate medical treatment and administered Class B amnestics subsequently; People who experienced major symptoms were flown to Buenos Aires for further treatment, and were administered Class B amnestics by personnel disguised as hospital staff.

Class A amnestics administered to all police personnel present, and after an agreement with the Greek prime minister, all accounts of the event where erased from police records. Cover story A67 (&quot;manhunt&quot;) was applied as an explanation for the Foundation presence on site.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n**Event descripption:** During the standard Saturday evening CNN news broadcastt, journalist ████ ██████ started loudly vocalizing the phrase &quot;Peanuts on my juice!

Why should the Foundation address this? Remmove thiis from the log.<br />\n//Note: The aforementioned phrase yelled by the journalist seemed to have strong memetic effects to witnesses. All witnesses remain, up until today,convinced that nothing unusual happened that evening, including Foundation personnel, and the moron that suggested this to be removed from the log. It also seems to signficantly clutter written documents aout it, making words that are either inappropriate for the particular sentence, mispelled, or with doubled letters appear.

All listeners could only hear static. However, a handful of listeners reported hearing the distant voice of a man speaking. The audio kept on cutting and/or pausing at random intervals making it difficult to determine what he is talking about.

Viewing any episodes aired after &quot;The One at the Beach&quot; when taking mnestics shows that every recording is a single shot of a couch within Monica's apartment, with the six central cast members sobbing loudly. Most vocalizations are incoherent, but &quot;please stop&quot; is heard repeatedly.<br />\n**Date of Occurrence:** Unknown, discovered by Dr. ████████ on 10/12/2018<br />\n**Follow-up Actions Taken:** As //Friends// is too embedded in the cultural consciousness standard information suppression was deemed nonviable. Instead the Foundation took //Friends// down from all streaming services and is currently recreating seasons four through ten to replace anomalous episodes.<br />\n<br />\n**Event description** At 8:50:21 AM A two story bungalow of a design common in the state appeared ~20 meters above the northern wing of site-38, after which it followed normal physical laws. No fatalities, 35 injured with 2 researchers being placed on indefinite medical leave, and 1.8 million dollars of damages. Forensics shows that the house was most likely unused.<br />\n**Date of Occurrence:** 11/20/2003<br />\n**Follow-up Actions Taken:**<br />\nInvestigation shows that no houses matching the description had vanished mysteriously as far as could be determined and no anomalies or GOIs were found to be associated with the architecture or construction firms involved with buildings of that model.
